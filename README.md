Graphical-Calculator
====================
This is a graphical calculator that plots graph of the equation of curve user gives.
This program right now supports simple equations that have only one pair of bracket, only one x coordinate in the equation,
addition, subtraction, multiplication and raising power of x coordinate to any positive integer.
This program doesnt support more than a pair of brackets, trignometric equations & factor or negative powers.
Always write the x coordinate at the begining like this: x+2. Writing it this way will not work: 2+x
